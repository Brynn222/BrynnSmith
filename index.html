						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>	My name is Brynn Smith and I’m a premedical student. I love to be active outdoors, volunteering, and working with kids. I’ve always known I wanted to be a doctor, but as life has gone on and I’ve gained life experience in the medical field, that dream has solidified. I am a confident, fast learning, detail-oriented person that has found my path in life.</p>  
						<br />
						<p>		I am an accomplished and active member of every community I become a part of, by providing service, passion, and execution of benefits to the people around me. I have always been dedicated to service and medicine. Becoming a physician is a lifelong dream. In the last few years I have discovered the true tenacity required to survive this journey, and it only fuels my drive to help others and make an impact on someone’s life in my future.</p>

                <p>Growing up in and around hospitals, I began to distinguish between different qualities of doctors. I aspire to become the kind of doctor I always wished I had. Someone who is dedicated to healthcare and truly makes a positive impact on the lives of their patients.</p>

                <p>As a neuroscience major, I am gaining a comprehensive foundation in all aspects of science including psychology, physiology, and anatomy. My goal is to become a neurosurgeon. This major provides understanding specified towards this goal, as well as flexibility should my dream specialty change.</p>

											<a href="Community.html"><h3>Community Service</h3></a>
										</header>
										<p>Service has been a lifelong commitment, rooted in my family's involvement in maintaining a local Scouts BSA Camp since the 1980s. Throughout high school, I discovered my own passion projects beyond the camp, and from then on, I've continually broadened my efforts by exploring new initiatives to contribute to the well-being of my community. Currently, I enjoy creating and participating in nonprofits that focus on benefiting children or supporting the unhoused. </p>

											<a href="Research.html"><h3>Research</h3></a>
										</header>
										<p>Since the Fall of 2022, I have been actively involved in a neuroscience lab, focusing on zebrafish research. My work revolves around studying the impact of microbe transmission on social behavior in correlation to social deficit disorders. Engaging in this research has not only provided valuable insights into the field but has also presented numerous opportunities to enhance my understanding of biological sciences, present in front of experts, and understand myself as someone with Autism Spectrum Disorder. </p>

											<a href="Extra.html"><h3>Extracurriculars</h3></a>
										</header>
										<p>My interests outside of medicine are diverse, making it a challenge to pick just a few to highlight. Outdoors, I transform into a different person, whether engaging in Scouting, hiking, Geology Club field trips, or playing flag football. I also equally enjoy indoor activities like baking, ceramics, playing video games, and drawing with friends. As the president of the Chemistry Club, I'm actively involved in fostering a passion for chemistry at my university, and I'm on track to become a board member of the Asklepiads Pre-Med Society in the Fall of 2024.</p>

										</header>
										<p>I've had the privilege of shadowing different medical specialties and continue to explore new opportunities through connections made in my medical journey. I've shadowed EMTs, gaining insights into the early stages of medical emergencies. In contrast, I observed nursing in the PACU, seeing the recovery process and the essential support nurses offer. I found neurosurgery particularly intriguing during my shadowing at the UW, where I followed multiple physicians and observed various subspecialties within my primary field of interest.</p>
