                                            <h4>Clubs</h4>
										</header>
										<p>I take great pride in my involvement in various clubs at my school, such as Chemistry Club, the Asklepiads Pre-Med Society, and Geology Club. Serving as the current President of the Chemistry Club, I am responsible for planning meetings throughout the year, coordinating significant events with the chemistry department, and managing social media. Within the Asklepiads, I act as a mentor, guiding an underclassman through the pre-med process. I aim to apply for the board next year as the Diversity Equity and Inclusion Officer. Geology Club provides me with a welcoming community and an opportunity to explore the outdoors on field trips, deepening my understanding of nature.</p>

                                            <h4>Drawing & Ceramics</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Indoor creative outlets are my favorite past time during the winter months. I found a love for drawing with charcoal in high school while doing portraits of my friends. I also took a ceramics class my junior year of high school, my university has a free craft center available with a full ceramic studio. As a refreshing break from my hard science coursework, I've been experimenting with underglazes to add vibrant colors to my clay and craft unique pieces.</p>

                                            <h4>Building</h4>
										</header>
										<p>Growing up with an engineering dad it was instilled in me to have a sense of handiness and independence. I have hands-on experience in building projects, including a lending library, framing cabins at Camp Parsons, constructing a pantry shelf at school, and various personal projects. I’ve also learned basic skills in wiring and plumbing, preparing me to be a responsible and thrifty homeowner in the future. The lessons of hard work, problem-solving, and hands-on skills that I've acquired apply to my life when I least expect it.</p>

                                            <h4>Baking</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Baking and experimenting in the kitchen was my earliest hobby. I developed a love for crafting recipes alongside my family and babysitters growing up. While some people turn to stress eating, exercising, or shopping sprees, I find solace in stress baking. During testing seasons, my roommates can always find me in the kitchen, whipping up scones, cakes, cookies, and more. Following a recipe and creating something delicious is not only calming but has also proven beneficial in building connections and surprisingly translated well to following procedures in chemistry labs.</p>

                                            <h4>Exploring</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Spending time outdoors is my favorite way to enjoy a beautiful day. Growing up in Seattle and as a Scout, I explored the Olympic Mountains and the North Cascades through hiking and backpacking. Sharing these favorite spots with friends and introducing them to the outdoors is one of my simple pleasures. Regardless of what challenges may arise, everything feels better when I have the opportunity to walk through the trees or go climbing by the ocean. Going to school in Oregon has given me the chance to find all kinds of new destinations. </p>

                                            <h4>Sports</h3>
										</header>
										<p>In college, I've found joy and distraction in participating in intramural flag football, basketball, and volleyball teams. Throughout my life, my love for playing sports has been a constant. Being female and 6'2" since the 6th grade, I found coaches eager to recruit me for various teams even if height wasn’t a real advantage in the sport. I have a history of competitive play in basketball, tennis, track, and soccer. Beyond traditional sports, I've enjoyed recreational target shooting through the scouts and explored other non-traditional sporty activities.</p>
