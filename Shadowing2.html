													<h3>Nursing</h3>
												</header>
												<p>During my shadowing experience in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), I had the privilege of engaging with various medical professionals, including neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists, and orthopedic and cardiovascular surgeons. This opportunity allowed me to witness firsthand the intricacies of pre- and post-surgical care, including nerve blocks, and facilitated conversations and insights with healthcare professionals that I wasnâ€™t expecting.</p>
												<p>One particularly memorable encounter involved a high school-aged girl undergoing surgery for a wrestling-related leg injury, aspiring to become a firefighter. Drawing upon my shared background as a former high school athlete and volunteer at a fire station, I established a meaningful connection with the patient. Recognizing her apprehension regarding needles and the fear of not being in control during surgery, I collaborated with the nursing team and anesthesiologist to alleviate her concerns. Our rapport served as a reassuring factor, and I committed to checking in on her after her surgery. Witnessing her resilience during the nerve block procedure and fulfilling the promise of support during the recovery process of her surgery highlighted the importance of empathy and patient-centered care. </p>
												<p>The PACU shadowing experience provided a comprehensive view of patient care, from when their walk in until discharge. I have a newfound and deeper appreciation for the indispensable role of a compassionate nursing team in the healthcare system. The nurses and medical professionals in the PACU willingly shared their knowledge, responding to my questions and offering valuable insights not only into their respective careers but also into their experiences collaborating with specialists across the hospital. The PACU emerged as a true epicenter of information and a vital resource, deserving of greater recognition for its significant contributions to the healthcare landscape.</p>
