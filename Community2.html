													<h3>Station 41 - EMS </h3>
												</header>
												<p>My volunteering experience with Station 41 in Brinnon, WA, has consistently surpassed my expectations. Unlike traditional shadowing, I actively participate in providing hands-on care and respond to emergency calls as an integral part of the department. Due to its rural location, the station relies heavily on volunteers as a part of its staff. Through the department I've obtained my EVIP, allowing me to drive emergency vehicles in Washington. I've also received in-house training on various crucial skills, including IV insertion, operating the LUCAS CPR device, pelvis binding, splinting, applying tourniquets, and securing someone on a backboard.</p>
												<p>One of the most impactful calls I attended was a head-on collision on the highway near the station. The incident involved an elderly woman turning into the path of an oncoming pickup truck. As the first responder on scene, I coordinated efforts to assess and provide assistance. The woman involved was trapped, and I assisted in using the jaws of life to remove the roof of her car so she could be extracted and airlifted from the middle of the highway. Meanwhile, I engaged with the young man involved, ensuring he was cognitively sound and providing emotional support. This experience reinforced my ability to remain calm, focused, and effective in emergency situations, validating my capability to rush towards danger and contribute to saving lives.</p>
												<p>While the adrenaline rush of saving lives in emergencies is exhilarating, volunteering at this rural fire department has also provided me with a sense of community. Beyond the intense calls, the department fosters a strong bond among its members. They put on monthly outdoor movie screenings in the local state park and share concessions to create a lively atmosphere for everyone, especially the kids that are camping with their families. The station itself feels like one big family, with invitations to barbecues and Christmas parties. This community has shown me how to transform the extreme situations they face into connections with fellow community members. Their commitment extends beyond the adrenaline-inducing calls, offering a service of security and general wellness. Iâ€™m inspired by these people and this experience, I want to contribute to and create a similar sense of community in my future career and hometown.</p>
