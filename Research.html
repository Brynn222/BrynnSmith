										<p>In October 2023 I had the pleasure of attending the SACNAS, NDiSTEM (National Diversity in STEM) Conference after being selected as an undergraduate presenter. I made and presented my first ever poster on the research I had been conducting since the Fall of 2022 in the Eisen Lab at University of Oregon. The program of the conference featured a powwow, inspirational panels, and opportunities to connect individuals with mentors who not only shared their backgrounds but also expressed a genuine willingness to support them. I had the privilege of attending numerous of these panels that not only contributed to my professional growth but also provided valuable networking opportunities with like-minded and accomplished individuals. These interactions broadened my understanding of adversity as I listened to the experiences of others in the STEM community. The conference equipped me with the knowledge and tools to better support and advocate for the BIPOC population, both as an ally and as a peer in various STEM fields.</p>
										<p>Additionally, I had the chance to explore 500+ exhibitors who participated in the conference, including 24+ esteemed medical schools. Their presence allowed me to learn about the diversity of program structures, the rigor of residency match rates, and the distinction between competitive and cooperative learning environments within medical education.</p>

										<h1>Abstract</h1>
										<p>
											Impaired social interactions are a hallmark of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our own observations in zebrafish and a growing literature reveal that host-associated microbes play a critical role in social behaviors. However, how these microbes are acquired, and the mechanisms of their interaction with social behavior remain unknown. We are taking advantage of the tractable genetics and excellent imaging properties of both zebrafish and their associated bacteria to investigate the properties of bacterial transmission between zebrafish individuals during social interactions. 
											We analyzed the time course of bacterial transmission by testing 1, 3, 6, and 8-hour time points of interaction between two fish, each inoculated with the same species of native bacteria, but expressing different fluorophores. We found that the number of transmission events increased with time, with little to no transmission after only 1 hour of interaction, and up to 40% transmission after 8 hours of interaction. We observed that transmission events were often non-reciprocal, which we interpret as the result of non-reciprocal social interactions between individuals. We also found that features of bacterial transmission differed between the skin and the gut. These results provide a baseline for our future experiments to understand what specific aspects of zebrafish social behavior promote bacterial transmission and how transmission is altered in zebrafish mutants with impaired social interactions.
