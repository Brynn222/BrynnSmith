													<h3>Neurosurgery</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Over the course of several days, I engaged in a comprehensive observation experience at the University of Washington Medical Center, where I had the privilege of shadowing esteemed neurosurgeons. Specifically, I was assigned to observe the practices of Dr. Melanie Walker, specializing in endovascular neurosurgical treatment; Dr. Jacob Ruzevick, focusing on endoscopic tumor removal; and Dr. Samuel Emerson, an expert in tumor removal. Following the designated procedures, I was afforded the opportunity to explore additional surgeries by consulting the schedule board.</p>
												<p>Throughout my time in the neurosurgical department, I witnessed three to four procedures daily, although not exclusively performed by the initially assigned physician. A notable encounter I had with a patient left a lasting impression. Following her pre-operative consultation, during which I was introduced as a shadowing student, the patient expressed her confidence in my future success, offering words of encouragement. Despite facing a challenging bifrontal craniotomy on one of the most difficult days of her life, I found solace in establishing a meaningful connection with her. Balancing empathy with professional detachment, I was able to provide support to the patient and maintain a focused presence in the operating room. The unique opportunity to stand alongside the surgeons, pose questions, and witness intricate procedures was invaluable. However, the ability to forge a genuine connection with a patient highlighted the significance of the human aspect in the medical field. </p>
												<p>This experience not only reaffirmed my aspirations within the neurosurgery profession but also fueled my curiosity for diverse and pioneering subspecialties. Armed with a deeper understanding of the day-to-day responsibilities of neurosurgeons, I am excited to explore various subspecialties in the field during my medical education, allowing for a more informed decision regarding my future career path.</p>
