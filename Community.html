													<h3>Occupy Medical</h3>
												</header>
												<p>I am actively engaged with Occupy Medical, a non-profit free clinic where I serve as a board member. During my undergraduate years, this experience has been profoundly impactful. The clinic extends support to the communities of Eugene, Springfield, and Cottage Grove, addressing the healthcare needs of those facing challenges due to homelessness. In my role, I collaborate with a team of nurses and physicians, gaining hands-on experience in patient care.</p>
												<p>Within the clinic, I contribute to patient intake and triage by engaging in one-on-one discussions to understand their needs. Whether it's connecting them with a physician at the clinic or providing essential items like warm socks or ibuprofen, I play a crucial role in assessing and addressing their immediate needs. As a board member I get to take on responsibilities such as managing the social media and website, brainstorming ideas, and executing plans to enhance clinic services. Currently, I am working on affiliating our non-profit as a club at my university, aiming to expand our services on campus and improve outreach to student patients and volunteers.</p>
												<p>One of my significant experiences at the clinic involved assisting a gentleman whom my coworkers found challenging to communicate with. Despite his closed-off demeanor, it was clear that he needed help, expressing some reluctance to sign papers due to a lack of understanding. Drawing on my own experience of being on the spectrum, I sensed that he might share a similar mindset and was struggling with overstimulation, requiring a more in-depth explanation of the paperwork and some general patience my teammates weren’t offering.</p>
												<p>Recognizing the common mistrust or reservations about official documents among homeless individuals, I approached the situation with a certain amount of understanding. Over the course of 45 minutes, I was able to get through to him, guiding him through the intake paperwork. Though it took much longer than usual, the rewarding experience further solidified my commitment to ensuring equal and compassionate healthcare for everyone. He got the care he needed and that’s what made me so excited and why his story stuck with me. This encounter reaffirmed my belief that my unique blend of patience and dedication holds a valuable place in the field of medicine.</p>
